Challenge Assignment 7

The assignment was to create a program that generates a readme.md file using JavaScript, node.js and the Inquirer package.

To begin, I installed Inquirer, and wrote several prompts that users would answer. Then, I created a skeleton readme.md and added that to the index.js file, and created a response object that would then write the responses the user gave and the skeleton into a new readme.md file.

A video walkthrough on the functionality of the program can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JsLZIErPu1ed4bIQ2pz0aHgriMMkGPTu/view
